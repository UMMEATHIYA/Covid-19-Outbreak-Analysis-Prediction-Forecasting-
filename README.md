# Covid-19-Outbreak-Analysis-Prediction-Forecasting

<h3><b> Overview </b></h3><br>
COVID 19 which is also known as Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus which started showing up late November 2019 in Mainland China. The
primary host of this spreading virus are bats (Chiroptera). Humans feeding on bats or the intermediate hosts are the carriers of this virus. The spread of virus is so
fast and vigorous that it happens through human to human transmission, thus it is handled by a genuine activity termed “Social Distancing”.<br>

<h3><b>Existing System</b></h3><br>
COVID 19, Its almost 8-9 months passed bearing the rising number of cases in the virus. The Government has taken various measures to break the pandemic chain spread.
Despite the continuous efforts of Government in bringing the lockdown effect, the situation is still increasing to its peak.This is majorly caused by the people who
lack maintaining the ‘social distancing’ policy, wearing ‘face mask’, & constantly having ‘sanitized’ (washing hands regularly).<br>
  
<h3><b>Proposed System</b></h3><br>
With the above rising issues stated in the existing system, the work focuses on building a platform where in the people are educated by showing them with stuffs like
visualizations, forecasting models, increase of cases, deaths & recoveries on daily basis. All these concepts involve the idea of Machine Learning algorithms, the
time series forecasting models, & Web Scraping.<br>

<h3><b>Implementation</b></h3>
<h4><b>i) FB Prophet Model</b></h4><br>
FB Prophet Model is one the Machine Learning Model used in forecasting with the statistical data. This model is an additive model which basically fits the data on
yearly, weekly, daily seasonality, & holiday effects. These are sinewy to missing data and capable of handling the outliers.<br>
The basic characteristics of Prophet Model are –
i)<b> Accurate & Fast</b> – which produces effective, reliable forecasts & is sheer goal setter.<br>
ii)<b> Fully Automatic</b> – analyses of drastic change in the time series graphs & handles the outliers or the missing data.<br>

<h4><b>ii) Arima Model</b></h4><br>
Arima, abbreviated as Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average. It is a machine learning algorithm extensively used in forecasting with the available time series
statistical data. It captures the distinct level of profane structures. <br>
Expansion of Acronym –
i)<b>AR: Autoregression </b>– specifies the relation among some random observations & lagged observations.<br>
ii)<b> I: Integrated </b>– involves differentiating the raw observations.<br>
iii)<b> MA: Moving Average </b>– it is dependent on two factors: Observations & the residual errors.<br>

<h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
The proposed project aims to provide the users with knowledge & insights of the rise in the number of confirmed cases & the deaths happening. The people have to
take necessary precautionary measures like inhibiting the social distancing activity, avoiding unnecessary roaming, wearing face mask, keeping ourselves sanitized.
The main aim is the proposed system provides with the forecasting graphs and its corresponding values through which necessary actions can be taken. The graphs that
helps in predicting the forecast values indicate a sign of danger in India and Karnataka, the actual cases cross the line of mark from the predicted value.
Thus stay at home and be safe...!
