<h3><b> Overview </b></h3><br>
COVID 19 which is also known as Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus which started showing up late November 2019 in Mainland China. The
primary host of this spreading virus are bats (Chiroptera). Humans feeding on bats or the intermediate hosts are the carriers of this virus. The spread of virus is so
fast and vigorous that it happens through human to human transmission, thus it is handled by a genuine activity termed “Social Distancing”.<br>

<h3><b>Existing System</b><h3><br>
COVID 19, Its almost 8-9 months passed bearing the rising number of cases in the virus. The Government has taken various measures to break the pandemic chain spread.
Despite the continuous efforts of Government in bringing the lockdown effect, the situation is still increasing to its peak.This is majorly caused by the people who
lack maintaining the ‘social distancing’ policy, wearing ‘face mask’, & constantly having ‘sanitized’ (washing hands regularly).<br>
  
<h3><b>Proposed System</b><h3><br>
With the above rising issues stated in the existing system, the work focuses on building a platform where in the people are educated by showing them with stuffs like
visualizations, forecasting models, increase of cases, deaths & recoveries on daily basis. All these concepts involve the idea of Machine Learning algorithms, the
time series forecasting models, & Web Scraping.<br>

<h3><b>High Level System Design</b></h3><br>
